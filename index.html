        This audio demonstrates my understanding of English grammar structures, the correct
        use of modal verbs like should, must, have, and proper pronunciation to express attitudes,
        beliefs, and obligations in academic and work contexts.

        <h2>Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
        <p class="date">Posted on November 2025</p>
        <p>
          Today we are surrounded by news, videos, and opinions everywhere we go. That's why critical thinking matters so much. It means stopping for a moment,
          checking the facts, and not believing something just because it appears on our screen. 
          <p>Media literacy helps us understand how information is created. Some posts are edited, exaggerated, or designed to manipulate us. Fake news spreads
          fast, and many people share things without verifying the source.</p>
        </p>
        <p>For me, thinking critically is like having a filter. Before I believe or share anything, I ask: Is this real? Who is saying it? What proof do they give?
          Using this mindset helps us avoid misinformation and become smarter online users.</p>

        <h2>Crime and Punishment</h2>
        <p class="date">Posted on November 2025</p>
        <p>Every society deals with crime, and punishment is the way we respond to it. The goal is to keep people safe and make sure there are consequences for harmful actions.
        </p>
        <p>Punishment can mean fines, community service, or prison. But there's always a debate: should we punish harder, or should we focus more on rehabilitation? Some people
        change when they get support and opportunities, while others may need stricter consequences.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, justice works best when it's balanced. Serious crimes need strong punishment, but helping people improve their lives can prevent future crime too. 
        Finding that balance is what really makes a system fair.</p>
